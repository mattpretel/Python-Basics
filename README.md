# Python Basics with Finance

In this project I will be using some basic python tools that will be the basis for analyzing any data. 
My goal is to show the basics such as; 

How to open a csv file,
Creating a file path, 
Defining Variables,
Using Dictreader, 
Creating if Statements,
and Writing Changes to a CSV Output.

After the use of these tools we I be able to create and print some summary statistics.
